      <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
      <p>AGRICULTURAL wastes can be anaerobically
        digested to product methane. Fertilizer nutrients in
        the wastes are recovered after the digestion process. The
        objectives of this study were to evaluate nutrient
        recovery, extractability and distribution between
        supernatant and sludge fractions. Three influent types
        prepared to 60 g/L total solids (TS), poultry manure-thin
        stillage mixture, dairy cattle and swine manure (PMT,
        CM and SM), were utilized in laboratory (35 °C)
        digestions with two retention times (16 and 24 days). </p>
        <p>While total Kjeldahl N of these wastes was
            approximately 100% recovered after digestion, 2N KCl
            extractable NH4+N was recovered in excess of 100% (229
            to 240% for PMT and 136 to 152% for CM and SM
            digesters) due to the mineralization of influent organic
            N. The extractable:total ratios of influent P, Ca and Mg
            were reduced (P by 19 to 30%, Ca by 19 to 24% and Mg
            by 6 to 20%) after digestion of PMT and SM. These
            ratios of K and Ca were reduced (by 9 to 11%) after
            digestion of CM. Reduced extractability may have
            resulted from increased nutrient sorption by manure
            solids after digestion. </p>
        <p>
            Centrifugation distributed NH4+N and K between
supernatant and sludge fractions in proportions that
paralleled the effluent total mass distribution between
those fractions and distributed P, Ca and Mg in
proportions that paralleled effluent TS distribution.
Since supernatants accounted for most of the mass, a
majority of the effluent NH4+N (58.9 to 83.4) and total K
(60.0 to 80.0%) was present in the supernatants. Since
the sludges accounted for most of the TS, a majority of
the effluent total P (59.6 to 85.8%), total Ca (56.6 to
81.0%) and total Mg (58.8 to 75.1%) was present in the
sludges.
